# TensorFlow Experiments

Experimental implementations of various things with TensorFlow. Here GANs and
VAEs were tested on MNIST. RNNs were tested on some time-series datasets, e.g.
[UCR Time Series Classification Archive](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/)
or the trivial positive/negative-slope dataset generated by
*generate_trivial_datasets.py*.
